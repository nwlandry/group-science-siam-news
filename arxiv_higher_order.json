Ryser conjectured that every\n$r$-partite hypergraph $\\mathcal{H}$ satisfies the inequality\n$\\tau(\\mathcal{H}) \\leq (r-1) \\nu (\\mathcal{H})$. This conjecture is open for\nall $r \\ge 4$. For intersecting hypergraphs, namely those with\n$\\nu(\\mathcal{H})=1$, Ryser's conjecture reduces to $\\tau(\\mathcal{H}) \\leq\nr-1$. Even this conjecture is extremely difficult and is open for all $ r \\ge\n6$. For infinitely many $r$ there are examples of intersecting $r$-partite\nhypergraphs with $\\tau(\\mathcal{H})=r-1$, demonstrating the tightness of the\nconjecture for such $r$. However, all previously known constructions are not\noptimal as they use far too many edges. How sparse can an intersecting\n$r$-partite hypergraph be, given that its cover number is as large as possible,\nnamely $\\tau(\\mathcal{H}) \\ge r-1$? In this paper we solve this question for $r\n\\le 5$, give an almost optimal construction for $r=6$, prove that any\n$r$-partite intersecting hypergraph with $\\tau(H) \\ge r-1$ must have at least\n$(3-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{18}})r(1-o(1)) \\approx 2.764r(1-o(1))$ edges, and conjecture\nthat there exist constructions with $\\Theta(r)$ edges.\n",

We give a dichotomy theorem\nfor $r>2$, showing for which $H$ this problem is in FP and for which $H$ it is\n#P-complete. This generalises a theorem of Dyer and Greenhill (2000) for the\ncase $r=2$, which corresponds to counting graph homomorphisms. Our dichotomy\ntheorem extends to the case in which the relation $H$ is weighted, and the goal\nis to compute the \\emph{partition function}, which is the sum of weights of the\nhomomorphisms. This problem is motivated by statistical physics, where it\narises as computing the partition function for particle models in which certain\ncombinations of $r$ sites interact symmetrically. In the weighted case, our\ndichotomy theorem generalises a result of Bulatov and Grohe (2005) for graphs,\nwhere $r=2$. When $r=2$, the polynomial time cases of the dichotomy correspond\nsimply to rank-1 weights. Surprisingly, for all $r>2$ the polynomial time cases\nof the dichotomy have rather more structure. It turns out that the weights must\nbe superimposed on a combinatorial structure defined by solutions of an\nequation over an Abelian group. Our result also gives a dichotomy for a closely\nrelated constraint satisfaction problem.\n",

Sophisticated but non-rigorous\narguments from statistical mechanics have ascribed this discrepancy to the\nexistence of a phase transition called condensation that occurs shortly before\nthe actual threshold for the existence of solutions and that affects the\ncombinatorial nature of the problem (Krzakala, Montanari, Ricci-Tersenghi,\nSemerjian, Zdeborova: PNAS 2007). In this paper we prove for the first time\nthat a condensation transition exists in a natural random CSP, namely in random\nhypergraph 2-coloring. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the second moment\nmethod breaks down strictly \\emph{before} the condensation transition. Our\nproof also yields slightly improved bounds on the threshold for random\nhypergraph 2-colorability.

To formulate precise results, we introduce the\nsetting of simplicial complexes with minimum degree sequences, which is a\ngeneralisation of the usual minimum degree condition. We determine the\nessentially best possible minimum degree sequence for finding an almost perfect\nmatching. Furthermore, our main result establishes the stability property:\nunder the same degree assumption, if there is no perfect matching then there\nmust be a space or divisibility barrier.

In this paper we shall study a specific instance of Voloshin's\nidea: a non-monochromatic non-rainbow (NMNR) colouring of a hypergraph is a\ncolouring of its vertices such that every edge has at least two vertices\ncoloured with different colours (non-monochromatic) and no edge has all of its\nvertices coloured with distinct colours (non-rainbow). Perhaps the most\nintriguing phenomenon of such colourings is that a hypergraph can have gaps in\nits NMNR chromatic spectrum, that is, for some $k_1 < k_2 < k_3$, the\nhypergraph is NMNR colourable with $k_1$ and with $k_3$ colours but not with\n$k_2$ colours.\n  Several beautiful examples have been constructed of NMNR colourings of\nhypergraphs exhibiting phenomena not seen in classical colourings. Many of\nthese examples are either \\emph{ad hoc} or else are based on designs. The\nlatter are difficult to construct and they generally give uniform\n$r$-hypergraphs only for low values of $r$, generally $r=3$. In this paper we\nshall study the NMNR colourings of a type of $r$-uniform hypergraph which we\ncall $\\sigma$-hypergraphs. The attractive feature of these $\\sigma$-hypergraphs\nis that they are easy to define, even for large $r$, and that, by suitable\nmodifications of their parameters, they can give families of hypergraphs which\nare guaranteed to have NMNR spectra with gaps or NMNR spectra without gaps.\nThese $\\sigma$-hypergraphs also team up very well with the notion of\ncolour-bounded hypergraphs recently introduced by Bujt{\\'a}s and Tuza to give\nfurther control on the appearance of gaps and perhaps explain better the\nexistence of gaps in the colouring of mixed hypergraphs.\n",

The adjacency, Laplacian and signless Laplacian tensors of\ncirculant hypergraphs are also symmetric circulant tensors. The adjacency,\nLaplacian and signless Laplacian tensors of directed circulant hypergraphs are\ncirculant tensors, but they are not symmetric in general. In this paper, we\nstudy spectral properties of circulant tensors and their applications in\nspectral hypergraph theory and stochastic process. We show that in certain\ncases, the largest H-eigenvalue of a circulant tensor can be explicitly\nidentified. In particular, the largest H-eigenvalue of a nonnegative circulant\ntensor can be explicitly identified. This confirms the results in circulant\nhypergraphs and directed circulant hypergraphs. We prove that an even order\ncirculant B$_0$ tensor is always positive semi-definite. This shows that the\nLaplacian tensor and the signless Laplacian tensor of a directed circulant\neven-uniform hypergraph are positive semi-definite. If a stochastic process is\n$m$th order stationary, where $m$ is even, then its $m$th order moment, which\nis a circulant tensor, must be positive semi-definite. In this paper, we give\nvarious conditions for a circulant tensor to be positive semi-definite.\n",

This classification is based on a beautiful connection to the so-called\nuniqueness phase transition from statistical physics on the infinite\n$\\Delta$-regular tree. Our objective is to study the impact of this\nclassification on unweighted 2-spin models on $k$-uniform hypergraphs. As has\nalready been indicated by Yin and Zhao, the connection between the uniqueness\nphase transition and the complexity of approximate counting breaks down in the\nhypergraph setting. Nevertheless, we show that for every non-trivial symmetric\n$k$-ary Boolean function $f$ there exists a degree bound $\\Delta_0$ so that for\nall $\\Delta \\geq \\Delta_0$ the following problem is NP-hard: given a\n$k$-uniform hypergraph with maximum degree at most $\\Delta$, approximate the\npartition function of the hypergraph 2-spin model associated with $f$. It is\nNP-hard to approximate this partition function even within an exponential\nfactor. By contrast, if $f$ is a trivial symmetric Boolean function (e.g., any\nfunction $f$ that is excluded from our result), then the partition function of\nthe corresponding hypergraph 2-spin model can be computed exactly in polynomial\ntime.\n",

We also obtain bounds on c_2(n,F) which are apart by at most 2 in\nthe cases where F is K_4^- (K_4 with one edge removed), K_5^-, and the tight\ncycle C_5 on 5 vertices.\n",

It turned out that the analogue of\nthe conjecture for hypergraphs can be answered: Z. Kir\\'aly proved that in\nevery k-coloring of the edges of the r-uniform complete hypergraph K^r (r >=\n3), the vertex set of K^r can be covered by at most $\\lceil k/r \\rceil$ sets,\neach connected in some color.\n  Here we investigate the analogue problem for complete r-uniform r-partite\nhypergraphs. An edge coloring of a hypergraph is called spanning if every\nvertex is incident to edges of any color used in the coloring. We propose the\nfollowing analogue of Ryser conjecture.\n  In every spanning (r+t)-coloring of the edges of a complete r-uniform\nr-partite hypergraph, the vertex set can be covered by at most t+1 sets, each\nconnected in some color.\n  Our main result is that the conjecture is true for 1 <= t <= r-1. We also\nprove a slightly weaker result for t >= r, namely that t+2 sets, each connected\nin some color, are enough to cover the vertex set.\n  To build a bridge between complete r-uniform and complete r-uniform r-partite\nhypergraphs, we introduce a new notion. A hypergraph is complete r-uniform\n(r,l)-partite if it has all r-sets that intersect each partite class in at most\nl vertices.\n  Extending our results achieved for l=1, we prove that for any r >= 3, 2 <= l\n<= r, k >= 1+r-l, in every spanning k-coloring of the edges of a complete\nr-uniform (r,l)-partite hypergraph, the vertex set can be covered by at most\n1+\\lfloor \\frac{k-r+\\ell-1}{\\ell}\\rfloor sets, each connected in some color.\n",

In the case when $F$ is a single edge, a perfect $F$-packing\nis simply a perfect matching. For a given fixed $F$, it is often the case that\nthe decision problem whether an $n$-vertex $k$-graph $H$ contains a perfect\n$F$-packing is NP-complete. Indeed, if $k \\geq 3$, the corresponding problem\nfor perfect matchings is NP-complete whilst if $k=2$ the problem is NP-complete\nin the case when $F$ has a component consisting of at least $3$ vertices.\n  In this paper we give a general tool which can be used to determine classes\nof (hyper)graphs for which the corresponding decision problem for perfect\n$F$-packings is polynomial time solvable. We then give three applications of\nthis tool: (i) Given $1\\leq \\ell \\leq k-1$, we give a minimum $\\ell$-degree\ncondition for which it is polynomial time solvable to determine whether a\n$k$-graph satisfying this condition has a perfect matching; (ii) Given any\ngraph $F$ we give a minimum degree condition for which it is polynomial time\nsolvable to determine whether a graph satisfying this condition has a perfect\n$F$-packing; (iii) We also prove a similar result for perfect $K$-packings in\n$k$-graphs where $K$ is a $k$-partite $k$-graph.\n  For a range of values of $\\ell,k$ (i) resolves a conjecture of Keevash, Knox\nand Mycroft whilst (ii) answers a question of Yuster in the negative.

In this\npaper, we propose a new algorithm for testing copositivity of high order\ntensors, and then present applications of the algorithm in physics and\nhypergraphs. For this purpose, we first give several new conditions for\ncopositivity of tensors based on the representative matrix of a simplex. Then a\nnew algorithm is proposed with the help of a proper convex subcone of the\ncopositive tensor cone, which is defined via the copositivity of Z-tensors.\nFurthermore, by considering a sum-of-squares program problem, we define two new\nsubsets of the copositive tensor cone and discuss their convexity. As an\napplication of the proposed algorithm, we prove that the coclique number of a\nuniform hypergraph is equivalent with an optimization problem over the\ncompletely positive tensor cone, which implies that the proposed algorithm can\nbe applied to compute an upper bound of the coclique number of a uniform\nhypergraph. Then we study another application of the proposed algorithm on\nparticle physics in testing copositivity of some potential fields. At last,\nvarious numerical examples are given to show the performance of the algorithm.\n",

One useful\nfeature of the new lemma is its adaptiveness for the hypergraph setting.\n  Using this new method, we prove a conjecture of Verstra\\\"ete [37] that for\n$r\\ge 3$, every $r$-uniform hypergraph with average degree $\\Omega(k^{r-1})$\ncontains Berge cycles of $k$ consecutive lengths. This is sharp up to the\nconstant factor. As a key step and a result of independent interest, we prove\nthat every $r$-uniform linear hypergraph with average degree at least $7r(k+1)$\ncontains Berge cycles of $k$ consecutive lengths.\n  In both of these results, we have additional control on the lengths of the\ncycles, which therefore also gives us bounds on the Tur\\'an numbers of Berge\ncycles (for even and odd cycles simultaneously).

But including the Perron vector, there may have more\nthan one eigenvector corresponding to the spectral radius. The projective\neigenvariety associated with the spectral radius is the set of the eigenvectors\ncorresponding to the spectral radius considered in the complex projective\nspace. In this paper we proved that such projective eigenvariety admits a\nmodule structure, which is determined by the support of the tensor and can be\ncharacterized explicitly by solving the Smith normal form of the incidence\nmatrix of the tensor.

        "abstract": "  In this paper we generalize the concept of uniquely $K_r$-saturated graphs to\nhypergraphs. Let $K_r^{(k)}$ denote the complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $r$\nvertices. For integers $k,r,n$ such that $2\\le k <r<n$, a $k$-uniform\nhypergraph $H$ with $n$ vertices is uniquely $K_r^{(k)}$-saturated if $H$ does\nnot contain $K_r^{(k)}$ but adding to $H$ any $k$-set that is not a hyperedge\nof $H$ results in exactly one copy of $K_r^{(k)}$. Among uniquely\n$K_r^{(k)}$-saturated hypergraphs, the interesting ones are the primitive ones\nthat do not have a dominating vertex---a vertex belonging to all possible\n${n-1\\choose k-1}$ edges. Translating the concept to the complements of these\nhypergraphs, we obtain a natural restriction of $\\tau$-critical hypergraphs: a\nhypergraph $H$ is uniquely $\\tau$-critical if for every edge $e$,\n$\\tau(H-e)=\\tau(H)-1$ and $H-e$ has a unique transversal of size $\\tau(H)-1$.\n  We have two constructions for primitive uniquely $K_r^{(k)}$-saturated\nhypergraphs. One shows that for $k$ and $r$ where $4\\le k<r\\le 2k-3$, there\nexists such a hypergraph for every $n>r$. This is in contrast to the case $k=2$\nand $r=3$ where only the Moore graphs of diameter two have this property. Our\nother construction keeps $n-r$ fixed; in this case we show that for any fixed\n$k\\ge 2$ there can only be finitely many examples. We give a range for $n$\nwhere these hypergraphs exist. For $n-r=1$ the range is completely determined:\n$k+1\\le n \\le {(k+2)^2\\over 4}$. For larger values of $n-r$ the upper end of\nour range reaches approximately half of its upper bound. The lower end depends\non the chromatic number of certain Johnson graphs.\n",

When the edge density is below the threshold, we\nprove that all but a vanishing proportion of the vertices can be recoloured by\na sequence of colourings that recolour only one vertex at a time. This change\nin the geometry of the solution space has been hypothesised to be the cause of\nthe algorithmic barrier faced by naive colouring algorithms. Our calculations\nverify predictions made by statistical physicists using the non-rigorous cavity\nmethod.\n  The traditional model for problems of this type is the random colouring\nmodel, where a random hypergraph is chosen and then a random colouring of that\nhypergraph is selected. However, it is often easier to work with the planted\nmodel, where a random colouring is selected first, and then edges are randomly\nchosen which respect the colouring.

The classical voter model is a\nwell-established conceptual model to study such processes. In this work, we\ndefine a new form of adaptive (or co-evolutionary) voter model posed on a\nsimplicial complex, i.e., on a certain class of hypernetworks/hypergraphs. We\nuse the persuasion rule along edges of the classical voter model and the\nrecently studied re-wiring rule of edges towards like-minded nodes, and\nintroduce a new peer pressure rule applied to three nodes connected via a\n2-simplex. This simplicial adaptive voter model is studied via numerical\nsimulation. We show that adding the effect of peer pressure to an adaptive\nvoter model leaves its fragmentation transition, i.e., the transition upon\nvarying the re-wiring rate from a single majority state into to a fragmented\nstate of two different opinion subgraphs, intact. Yet, above and below the\nfragmentation transition, we observe that the peer pressure has substantial\nquantitative effects. It accelerates the transition to a single-opinion state\nbelow the transition and also speeds up the system dynamics towards\nfragmentation above the transition. Furthermore, we quantify that there is a\nmultiscale hierarchy in the model leading to the depletion of 2-simplices,\nbefore the depletion of active edges. This leads to the conjecture that many\nother dynamic network models on simplicial complexes may show a similar\nbehaviour with respect to the sequential evolution of simplicies of different\ndimensions.\n",

Another protocol\nis an explicit (and slightly simpler) version of the construction of Alon,\nMoitra and Sudakov, producing graphs with similar properties.

Given\n$d\\ge 2$, our $d$-choice algorithm chooses an edge $B\\in \\mathcal{H}^{(t)}$,\nuniformly at random, and then chooses a set $D$ of $d$ random bins from the\nselected edge $B$. The ball is allocated to a least-loaded bin from $D$, with\nties are broken randomly. We prove that if the hypergraphs\n$\\mathcal{H}^{(1)},\\ldots, \\mathcal{H}^{(m)}$ satisfy a \\emph{balancedness}\ncondition and have low \\emph{pair visibility}, then after allocating\n$m=\\Theta(n)$ balls, the maximum number of balls at any bin, called the\n\\emph{maximum load}, is at most $\\log_d\\log n+O(1)$, with high probability. The\nbalancedness condition enforces that bins appear almost uniformly within the\nhyperedges of $\\mathcal{H}^{(t)}$, $1\\le t\\le m$, while the pair visibility\ncondition measures how frequently a pair of bins is chosen during the\nallocation of balls. Moreover, we establish a lower bound for the maximum load\nattained by the balanced allocation for a sequence of hypergraphs in terms of\npair visibility, showing the relevance of the visibility parameter to the\nmaximum load. In Godfrey's model, each ball is forced to probe all bins in a\nrandomly selected hyperedge and the ball is then allocated in a least-loaded\nbin. Godfrey showed that if each $\\mathcal{H}^{(t)}$, $1\\le t\\le m$, is\nbalanced and $m=O(n)$, then the maximum load is at most one, with high\nprobability.

We\ndeduce this geometric fact from a purely combinatorial result about\ntrace-bounded hypergraphs, where an $r$-partite $r$-graph $H$ with partite\nclasses $V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_r$ is said to be $d$-trace-bounded if for each $2\n\\le i \\le r$, all the vertices of $V_i$ have degree at most $d$ in the trace of\n$H$ on $V_1 \\cup V_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup V_i$.

Say that an\n$r$-uniform hypergraph $\\mathcal{H}$ is \\emph{algebraic of complexity\n$(n,d,m)$} if the vertices of $\\mathcal{H}$ are elements of $\\mathbb{F}^{n}$\nfor some field $\\mathbb{F}$, and there exist $m$ polynomials\n$f_1,\\dots,f_m:(\\mathbb{F}^{n})^{r}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}$ of degree at most\n$d$ such that the edges of $\\mathcal{H}$ are determined by the zero-patterns of\n$f_1,\\dots,f_m$. The aim of this paper is to show that if an algebraic graph\n(or hypergraph) of complexity $(n,d,m)$ has good Ramsey properties, then at\nleast one of the parameters $n,d,m$ must be large. In 2001, R\\'onyai, Babai and\nGanapathy considered the bipartite variant of the Ramsey problem and proved\nthat if $G$ is an algebraic graph of complexity $(n,d,m)$ on $N$ vertices, then\neither $G$ or its complement contains a complete balanced bipartite graph of\nsize $\\Omega_{n,d,m}(N^{1/(n+1)})$. We extend this result by showing that such\n$G$ contains either a clique or an independent set of size $N^{\\Omega(1/ndm)}$\nand prove similar results for algebraic hypergraphs of constant complexity. We\nalso obtain a polynomial regularity lemma for $r$-uniform algebraic hypergraphs\nthat are defined by a single polynomial, that might be of independent interest.\nOur proofs combine algebraic, geometric and combinatorial tools.\n",

Nevertheless, the boundaries of these\nmethods for CSPs with non-Boolean domain are not well-understood. Our goal in\nthis paper is to fill in this gap and obtain strong inapproximability results\nby studying the prototypical problem in this class of CSPs, hypergraph\ncolourings.\n  More precisely, we focus on the problem of approximately counting\n$q$-colourings on $K$-uniform hypergraphs with bounded degree $\\Delta$. An\nefficient algorithm exists if $\\Delta\\lesssim \\frac{q^{K/3-1}}{4^KK^2}$ (Jain,\nPham, and Vuong, 2021; He, Sun, and Wu, 2021). Somewhat surprisingly however, a\nhardness bound is not known even for the easier problem of finding colourings.\nFor the counting problem, the situation is even less clear and there is no\nevidence of the right constant controlling the growth of the exponent in terms\nof $K$.\n  To this end, we first establish that for general $q$ computational hardness\nfor finding a colouring on simple/linear hypergraphs occurs at $\\Delta\\gtrsim\nKq^K$, almost matching the algorithm from the Lovasz Local Lemma. Our second\nand main contribution is to obtain a far more refined bound for the counting\nproblem that goes well beyond the hardness of finding a colouring and which we\nconjecture that is asymptotically tight (up to constant factors). We show in\nparticular that for all even $q\\geq 4$ it is NP-hard to approximate the number\nof colourings when $\\Delta\\gtrsim q^{K/2}$.\n",

We prove the\napproximate version of their conjecture.\n  This result follows from our general main results which concern finding\nperfect or almost perfect matchings in a hypergraph $G$ avoiding a given set of\nsubmatchings (which we view as a hypergraph $H$ where $V(H)=E(G)$). Our first\nmain result is a common generalization of the classical theorems of Pippenger\n(for finding an almost perfect matching) and Ajtai, Koml\\'os, Pintz, Spencer,\nand Szemer\\'edi (for finding an independent set in girth five hypergraphs).\nMore generally, we prove this for coloring and even list coloring, and also\ngeneralize this further to when $H$ is a hypergraph with small codegrees (for\nwhich high girth designs is a specific instance). Indeed, the coloring version\nof our result even yields an almost partition of $K_n^r$ into approximate high\ngirth $(n,q,r)$-Steiner systems.\n  Our main results also imply the existence of a perfect matching in a\nbipartite hypergraph where the parts have slightly unbalanced degrees.

The first contribution of this paper introduces\npolymatroidal cut functions, a large class of cut functions amenable to\napproximation algorithms via metric embeddings and routing multicommodity\nflows. We demonstrate an $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$-approximation, where $n$ is the\nnumber of vertices in the hypergraph, for these problems by rounding\nrelaxations to metrics of negative-type.\n  The second contribution of this paper generalizes the cut-matching game\nframework of Khandekar et. al. to tackle polymatroidal cut functions. This\nyields the first almost-linear time $O(\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for\nstandard versions of undirected and directed hypergraph partitioning. A\ntechnical consequence of our construction is that a cut-matching game which\ngreatly relaxes the set of allowed actions for both players can be used to\npartition hypergraphs with negligible impact on the approximation ratio.

All\nan object needs to do is rank nearby objects by similarity to itself, using a\nComparator which is transitive, but need not be consistent with any metric on\nthe whole set. Call this a ranking system on $S$. Rank-based linkage is applied\nto the $K$-nearest neighbor digraph derived from a ranking system. Computations\noccur on a 2-dimensional abstract oriented simplicial complex whose faces are\namong the points, edges, and triangles of the line graph of the undirected\n$K$-nearest neighbor graph on $S$. In $|S| K^2$ steps it builds an\nedge-weighted linkage graph $(S, \\mathcal{L}, \\sigma)$ where $\\sigma(\\{x, y\\})$\nis called the in-sway between objects $x$ and $y$. Take $\\mathcal{L}_t$ to be\nthe links whose in-sway is at least $t$, and partition $S$ into components of\nthe graph $(S, \\mathcal{L}_t)$, for varying $t$. Rank-based linkage is a\nfunctor from a category of out-ordered digraphs to a category of partitioned\nsets, with the practical consequence that augmenting the set of objects in a\nrank-respectful way gives a fresh clustering which does not ``rip apart`` the\nprevious one.

This paper extends the adaptive voter model to hypergraphs to\nexplore how forces of peer pressure influence collective decision-making. The\nmodel consists of two processes: individuals can either consult the group and\nchange their opinion or leave the group and join a different one. The interplay\nbetween those two processes gives rise to a two-phase dynamics. In the initial\nphase, the topology of the hypergraph quickly reaches a new stable state. In\nthe subsequent phase, opinion dynamics plays out on the new topology depending\non the mechanism by which opinions spread. If the group always follows the\nmajority, the network rapidly converges to fragmented communities. In contrast,\nif individuals choose an opinion proportionally to its representation in the\ngroup, the system remains in a metastable state for an extended period of time.\nThe results are supported both by stochastic simulations and an analytical\nmean-field description in terms of hypergraph moments with a moment closure at\nthe pair level.\n",

More\nprecisely, for a wide class of $G$, we find a randomised embedding $f\\colon\nG\\hookrightarrow H$ with the following property: for every $s$, for any partial\nembedding $f'$ of $s$ vertices of $G$ into $H$, the probability that $f$\nextends $f'$ is at most $O(1/n)^s$. This is a common generalisation of several\nstreams of research surrounding the classical Dirac-type problem.

This recovers and extends recent results of Glock,\nGould, Joos, K\\\"uhn, and Osthus and of Montgomery and Pavez-Sign\\'e regarding\nenumerating Hamilton cycles in Dirac hypergraphs. Moreover, using the recent\ndevelopments surrounding the Kahn--Kalai conjecture, this result implies that\nmany Dirac-type results hold robustly, meaning $G$ still embeds into $H$ after\na random sparsification of its edge set.

The study of these\nnumbers is one of the central topics in Combinatorics. In 1973, Erd\\H{o}s and\nGraham asked to maximize the Ramsey number of a graph as a function of the\nnumber of its edges. Motivated by this problem, we study the analogous question\nfor hypergaphs. For fixed $k \\ge 3$ and $q \\ge 2$ we prove that the largest\npossible $q$-color Ramsey number of a $k$-uniform hypergraph with $m$ edges is\nat most $\\mathrm{tw}_k(O(\\sqrt{m})),$ where $\\mathrm{tw}$ denotes the tower\nfunction. We also present a construction showing that this bound is tight for\n$q \\ge 4$. This resolves a problem by Conlon, Fox and Sudakov. They previously\nproved the upper bound for $k \\geq 4$ and the lower bound for $k=3$. Although\nin the graph case the tightness follows simply by considering a clique of\nappropriate size, for higher uniformities the construction is rather involved\nand is obtained by using paths in expander graphs.\n",

Our result\nimproves the number of parts in the partition to $O_{d,k}((D/\\varepsilon)^{d})$\nwhere $d$ is the dimension of the ambient space and $D$ is a measure of the\ncomplexity of the hypergraph; additionally, the partition is oblivious to the\nedge set of the hypergraph. We give examples that show that the dependence on\nboth $\\varepsilon$ and $D$ is optimal.\n  From this regularity lemma we deduce the best-known Tur\\'an-type result for\nsemialgebraic hypergraphs. Third, we prove a Zarankiewicz-type result for\nsemialgebraic hypergraphs. Previously Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl showed\nthat a $K_{u,u}$-free semialgebraic graph on $N$ vertices has at most\n$O_{d,D,u}(N^{2d/(d+1)+o(1)})$ edges and Do extended this result to\n$K_{u,\\ldots,u}^{(k)}$-free semialgebraic hypergraphs. We improve upon both of\nthese results by removing the $o(1)$ in the exponent and making the dependence\non $D$ and $u$ explicit and polynomial.\n  All three of these results follow from a novel ``multilevel polynomial\npartitioning scheme'' that efficiently partitions a point set\n$P\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ via low-complexity semialgebraic pieces. We prove this\nresult using the polynomial method over varieties as developed by Walsh which\nextends the real polynomial partitioning technique of Guth and Katz.\n  We give additional applications to the unit distance problem, the\nErd\\H{o}s--Hajnal problem for semialgebraic graphs, and property testing of\nsemialgebraic hypergraphs.\n",

Later\nwork by S\\'arkozy, Selkow and Szemer\\'edi showed that in fact Dirac graphs have\nmany Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings, culminating in a result of Cuckler\nand Kahn that gives a precise description of the numbers of Hamilton cycles and\nperfect matchings in a Dirac graph G (in terms of an entropy-like parameter of\nG).\n  In this paper we extend Cuckler and Kahn's result to perfect matchings in\nhypergraphs. For positive integers d < k, and for n divisible by k, let\n$m_{d}(k,n)$ be the minimum d-degree that ensures the existence of a perfect\nmatching in an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph. In general, it is an open\nquestion to determine (even asymptotically) the values of $m_{d}(k,n)$, but we\nare nonetheless able to prove an analogue of the Cuckler-Kahn theorem, showing\nthat if an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph G has minimum d-degree at least\n$(1+\\gamma)m_{d}(k,n)$ (for any constant $\\gamma>0$), then the number of\nperfect matchings in G is controlled by an entropy-like parameter of G.

Interestingly, the differential equations arising from many\nsuch models often exhibit a similar form, resulting in qualitatively comparable\nglobal bifurcation patterns. Motivated by this observation, we investigate a\ngeneralized mean-field-type model that provides a unified framework for\nanalysing a range of different models. In particular, we derive analytical\nconditions for the emergence of different bifurcation regimes exhibited by\nthree models of increasing complexity -- ranging from three- and four-body\ninteractions to two connected populations with both pairwise and three-body\ninteractions. For the first two cases, we give a complete characterisation of\nall possible outcomes, along with the corresponding conditions on network and\nepidemic parameters. In the third case, we demonstrate that multistability is\npossible despite only three-body interactions. Our results reveal that single\npopulation models with three-body interactions can only exhibit simple\ntranscritical transitions or bistability, whereas with four-body interactions\nmultistability with two distinct endemic steady states is possible.\nSurprisingly, the two-population model exhibits multistability via symmetry\nbreaking despite three-body interactions only. Our work sheds light on the\nrelationship between equation structure and model behaviour and makes the first\nstep towards elucidating mechanisms by which different system behaviours arise,\nand how network and dynamic properties facilitate or hinder outcomes.\n",

Computing or estimating $ex_F(G)$ for various pairs $F,G$ is\none of the central problems in extremal combinatorics. It is thus natural to\nask how hard is it to compute this function. Motivated by an old problem of\nYannakakis from the 80's, Alon, Shapira and Sudakov [ASS'09] proved that for\nevery non-bipartite graph $F$, computing $ex_F(G)$ is NP-hard. Addressing a\nconjecture of Ailon and Alon (2007), we prove a hypergraph analogue of this\ntheorem, showing that for every $k \\geq 3$ and every non-$k$-partite $k$-graph\n$F$, computing $ex_F(G)$ is NP-hard. Furthermore, we conjecture that our\nhardness result can be extended to all $k$-graphs $F$ other than a matching of\nfixed size. If true, this would give a precise characterization of the\n$k$-graphs $F$ for which computing $ex_F(G)$ is NP-hard, since we also prove\nthat when $F$ is a matching of fixed size, $ex_F(G)$ is computable in\npolynomial time. This last result can be considered an algorithmic version of\nthe celebrated Erd\\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem.\n  The proof of [ASS'09] relied on a variety of tools from extremal graph\ntheory, one of them being Tur\\'an's theorem. One of the main challenges we have\nto overcome in order to prove our hypergraph extension is the lack of a\nTur\\'an-type theorem for $k$-graphs.

Suppose a $3$-graph has the property that the link of every vertex has an $\\varepsilon$-homogenous partition of size $\\text{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)$. Does this guarantee that the $3$-graph also has a small homogenous partition? Terry and Wolf proved that such a $3$-graph has an $\\varepsilon$-homogenous partition of size given by a wowzer-type function. Terry recently improved this to a double exponential bound, and conjectured that this bound is tight. Our first result in this paper disproves this conjecture by giving an improved (single) exponential bound, which is best possible. We further obtain an analogous result for $k$-graphs of all uniformities $k \\geq 3$.\n  The above problem is part of a much broader programme which seeks to understand the conditions under which a (hyper)graph has small $\\varepsilon$-regular partitions. While this problem is fairly well understood for graphs, the situation is (as always) much more involved already for $3$-graphs. For example, it is natural to ask if one can strengthen our first result by only requiring each link to have $\\varepsilon$-regular partitions of size $\\text{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)$. Our second result shows that surprisingly the answer is `no', namely, a $3$-graph might only have regular partitions of tower-type size, even though the link of every vertex has an $\\varepsilon$-regular partition of polynomial size.",

        "abstract": "  Many important theorems in combinatorics, such as Szemer\\'edi's theorem on\narithmetic progressions and the Erd\\H{o}s-Stone Theorem in extremal graph\ntheory, can be phrased as statements about independent sets in uniform\nhypergraphs. In recent years, an important trend in the area has been to extend\nsuch classical results to the so-called sparse random setting. This line of\nresearch culminated recently in the breakthroughs of Conlon and Gowers and of\nSchacht, who developed general tools for solving problems of this type.\n  In this paper, we provide a third, completely different approach to proving\nextremal and structural results in sparse random sets. We give a structural\ncharacterization of the independent sets in a large class of uniform\nhypergraphs by showing that every independent set is almost contained in one of\na small number of relatively sparse sets. We then derive many interesting\nresults as fairly straightforward consequences of this abstract theorem. In\nparticular, we prove the well-known conjecture of Kohayakawa, \\L uczak and\nR\\\"odl, a probabilistic embedding lemma for sparse graphs. We also give\nalternative proofs of many of the results of Conlon and Gowers and Schacht, and\nobtain their natural counting versions, which in some cases are considerably\nstronger. We moreover prove a sparse version of the Erd\\H{o}s-Frankl-R\\\"odl\nTheorem on the number of H-free graphs and extend a result of R\\\"odl and\nRuci\\'nski on Ramsey properties in sparse random graphs to the general,\nnon-symmetric setting.\n  We remark that similar results have been discovered independently by Saxton\nand Thomason, and that, in parallel to this work, Conlon, Gowers, Samotij and\nSchacht have proved a sparse analogue of the counting lemma for subgraphs of\nthe random graph G(n,p), which may be viewed as a version of the K\\L R\nconjecture that is stronger in some ways and weaker in others.\n",

This notion, introduced by B{\\'u}jtas and Tuza, generalises\nboth classical hypergraph colourings and the more general Voloshin colourings\nof hypergraphs. In fact, for $r$-uniform hypergraphs, classical colourings\ncorrespond to $(2,r)$-colourings while an important instance of Voloshin\ncolourings of $r$-uniform hypergraphs gives $(2, r-1)$-colourings. One\nintriguing aspect of all these colourings, not present in classical colourings,\nis that $H$ can have gaps in its $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-spectrum, that is, for $k_1 <\nk_2 < k_3$, $H$ would be $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-colourable using $k_1$ and using\n$k_3$ colours, but not using $k_2$ colours.\n  In an earlier paper, the first two authors introduced, for $\\sigma$ a\npartition of $r$, a very versatile type of $r$-uniform hypergraph which they\ncalled $\\sigma$-hypergraphs. They showed that, by simple manipulation of the\nparameters of a $\\sigma$-hypergraph $H$, one can obtain families of hypergraphs\nwhich have $(2,r-1)$-colourings exhibiting various interesting chromatic\nproperties. They also showed that, if the smallest part of $\\sigma$ is at least\n2, then $H$ will never have a gap in its $(2,r-1)$-spectrum but, quite\nsurprisingly, they found examples where gaps re-appear when $\\alpha=\\beta=2$.\n  In this paper we extend many of the results of the first two authors to more\ngeneral $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-colourings, and we study the phenomenon of the\ndisappearanace and re-appearance of gaps and show that it is not just the\nbehaviour of a particular example but we place it within the context of a more\ngeneral study of constrained colourings of $\\sigma$-hypergraphs.\n",

        "abstract": "  Cuts in graphs are a fundamental object of study, and play a central role in\nthe study of graph algorithms. The problem of sparsifying a graph while\napproximately preserving its cut structure has been extensively studied and has\nmany applications. In a seminal work, Bencz\\'ur and Karger (1996) showed that\ngiven any $n$-vertex undirected weighted graph $G$ and a parameter $\\varepsilon\n\\in (0,1)$, there is a near-linear time algorithm that outputs a weighted\nsubgraph $G'$ of $G$ of size $\\tilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ such that the weight\nof every cut in $G$ is preserved to within a $(1 \\pm \\varepsilon)$-factor in\n$G'$. The graph $G'$ is referred to as a {\\em $(1 \\pm \\varepsilon)$-approximate\ncut sparsifier} of $G$.\n  A natural question is if such cut-preserving sparsifiers also exist for\nhypergraphs. Kogan and Krauthgamer (2015) initiated a study of this question\nand showed that given any weighted hypergraph $H$ where the cardinality of each\nhyperedge is bounded by $r$, there is a polynomial-time algorithm to find a $(1\n\\pm \\varepsilon)$-approximate cut sparsifier of $H$ of size\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{nr}{\\varepsilon^2})$. Since $r$ can be as large as $n$, in\ngeneral, this gives a hypergraph cut sparsifier of size\n$\\tilde{O}(n^2/\\varepsilon^2)$, which is a factor $n$ larger than the\nBencz\\'ur-Karger bound for graphs. It has been an open question whether or not\nBencz\\'ur-Karger bound is achievable on hypergraphs. In this work, we resolve\nthis question in the affirmative by giving a new polynomial-time algorithm for\ncreating hypergraph sparsifiers of size $\\tilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon^2)$.\n",

In many applications a simple pairwise coupling is\nnot sufficient to describe real-world phenomena as higher-order (or group)\ninteractions take place. Hence, we replace the classical coupling law with a\nvery general coupling function involving higher-order terms. Furthermore, we\nallow for multiple populations of oscillators interacting with each other\nthrough a very general law. In our analysis, we focus on the characteristic\nsystem and the mean-field limit of this generalized class of Kuramoto models.\nWhile there are several works studying particular aspects of our program, we\npropose a general framework to work with all three aspects (higher-order,\nmulti-population, and mean-field) simultaneously. Assuming identical\noscillators in each population, we derive equations for the evolution of\noscillator populations in the mean-field limit. First, we clarify existence and\nuniqueness of our set of characteristic equations, which are formulated in the\nspace of probability measures together with the bounded-Lipschitz metric. Then,\nwe investigate dynamical properties within the framework of the characteristic\nsystem. We identify invariant subspaces and stability of the state, in which\nall oscillators are synchronized within each population. Even though it turns\nout that this so called all-synchronized state is never asymptotically stable,\nunder some conditions and with a suitable definition of stability, the\nall-synchronized state can be proven to be at least locally stable. In summary,\nour work provides a rigorous mathematical framework upon which the further\nstudy of multi-population higher-order coupled particle systems can be based.\n",

The connection between Markov chains on graphs and their\ngeometric and topological structures is the main reason why such a wide range\nof theoretical and practical applications exist. Graph connectedness ensures\nirreducibility of a Markov chain. The convergence rate to the stationary\ndistribution is determined by the spectrum of the graph Laplacian which is\nassociated with lower bounds on graph curvature. Furthermore, walks on graphs\nare used to infer structural properties of underlying manifolds in data\nanalysis and manifold learning. However, an important question remains: can\nsimilar connections be established between Markov chains on simplicial\ncomplexes and the topology, geometry, and spectral properties of complexes?\nAdditionally, can we gain topological, geometric, or analytic information about\na manifold by defining appropriate Markov chains on its triangulations? These\nquestions are not only theoretically important but answers to them provide\npowerful tools for the analysis of complex networks that go beyond the analysis\nof pairwise interactions. In this paper, we provide an integrated overview of\nthe existing results on random walks on simplicial complexes, using the novel\nperspective of signed graphs. This perspective sheds light on previously\nunknown aspects such as irreducibility conditions. We show that while up-walks\non higher dimensional simplexes can never be irreducible, the down walks become\nirreducible if and only if the complex is orientable. We believe that this new\nintegrated perspective can be extended beyond discrete structures and enables\nexploration of classical problems for triangulable manifolds.\n",

Recently, this result was greatly extended by R\\\"aty, Sudakov, and\nTomon.

This bound is the best possible up to the precise value of $c$.\nMoreover, a bisection achieving this bound can be found by a polynomial-time\nrandomized algorithm.\n  The minimum bisection is closely related to discrepancy. We also prove sharp\nbounds on the discrepancy and so called positive discrepancy of hypergraphs,\nextending results of Bollob\\'as and Scott.

In our\nprevious work, we obtained an asymptotically tight upper bound via its\nconnection to the joints problem, a problem in incidence geometry.
