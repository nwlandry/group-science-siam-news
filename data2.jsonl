For projective planes over fields of odd size\\nq we show that the codegree threshold is between n/2-q+1 and n/2, but for\\nPG_2(4) we find the somewhat surprising phenomenon that the threshold is less\\nthan (1/2-c)n for some small c>0. We conclude by setting out a program for\\nfuture developments of this method to tackle other problems.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2008 10:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-23","authors_parsed":[["Keevash","Peter",""]]}\n"

In recent years, an important trend in the area has been to extend\\nsuch classical results to the so-called sparse random setting. This line of\\nresearch culminated recently in the breakthroughs of Conlon and Gowers and of\\nSchacht, who developed general tools for solving problems of this type.\\n  In this paper, we provide a third, completely different approach to proving\\nextremal and structural results in sparse random sets. We give a structural\\ncharacterization of the independent sets in a large class of uniform\\nhypergraphs by showing that every independent set is almost contained in one of\\na small number of relatively sparse sets.

For hypergraphs, the node\\ndegree $\\\\ell$ (number of hyperedges connected to a node) and the number of\\nneighbors $k$ of a node differ from each other in contrast to the case of\\ngraphs. Here, I calculate the distribution of the number of node neighbors in\\nrandom hypergraphs in which hyperedges of uniform rank $r$ have a homogeneous\\nprobability $p$ to appear. This distribution is equivalent to the degree\\ndistribution of ensembles of projected graphs from hypergraph or bipartite\\nnetwork ensembles, where the projection connects any two nodes in the projected\\ngraph when they are also connected in the hypergraph or bipartite network. The\\ncalculation is non-trivial due to the possibility that neighbor nodes belong\\nsimultaneously to multiple hyperedges (node overlaps). From the exact results,\\nthe traditional sparse (small $p$) asymptotic approximation to the distribution\\nis rederived and improved; the approximation exhibits Poisson-like behavior\\naccompanied by strong fluctuations modulated by power-law decays in the system\\nsize $N$ with decay exponents equal to the minimum number of overlapping nodes\\npossible for a given number of neighbors. It is shown that the dense limit\\ncannot be explained if overlaps are ignored, and the correct asymptotic\\ndistribution is provided.

In this paper we shall study a specific instance of Voloshin's\\nidea: a non-monochromatic non-rainbow (NMNR) colouring of a hypergraph is a\\ncolouring of its vertices such that every edge has at least two vertices\\ncoloured with different colours (non-monochromatic) and no edge has all of its\\nvertices coloured with distinct colours (non-rainbow). Perhaps the most\\nintriguing phenomenon of such colourings is that a hypergraph can have gaps in\\nits NMNR chromatic spectrum, that is, for some $k_1 < k_2 < k_3$, the\\nhypergraph is NMNR colourable with $k_1$ and with $k_3$ colours but not with\\n$k_2$ colours.\\n  Several beautiful examples have been constructed of NMNR colourings of\\nhypergraphs exhibiting phenomena not seen in classical colourings.

The question of determining the tower growth\\nrate of $r_k(s,n)$ for all $s \\\\ge k+1$ was posed by Erdos and Hajnal in 1972.\\n  (2) We show that determining the tower growth rate of $r_k(P_{k+1}, n)$ is\\nequivalent to determining the tower growth rate of $r_k(n,n)$, which is a\\nnotorious conjecture of Erdos, Hajnal and Rado from 1965 that remains open.\\n  Some related off-diagonal hypergraph Ramsey problems are also explored.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 15:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 18:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-01","authors_parsed":[["Mubayi","Dhruv",""],["Suk","Andrew",""]]}\n"

We then give three applications of\\nthis tool: (i) Given $1\\\\leq \\\\ell \\\\leq k-1$, we give a minimum $\\\\ell$-degree\\ncondition for which it is polynomial time solvable to determine whether a\\n$k$-graph satisfying this condition has a perfect matching; (ii) Given any\\ngraph $F$ we give a minimum degree condition for which it is polynomial time\\nsolvable to determine whether a graph satisfying this condition has a perfect\\n$F$-packing; (iii) We also prove a similar result for perfect $K$-packings in\\n$k$-graphs where $K$ is a $k$-partite $k$-graph.\\n  For a range of values of $\\\\ell,k$ (i) resolves a conjecture of Keevash, Knox\\nand Mycroft whilst (ii) answers a question of Yuster in the negative. In many\\ncases our results are best possible in the sense that lowering the minimum\\ndegree condition means that the corresponding decision problem becomes\\nNP-complete.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 13:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21","authors_parsed":[["Han","Jie",""],["Treglown","Andrew",""]]}\n"

In fact, this algorithm solves a more general problem\\nof computing the number of tight Euler tours in a given uniform hypergraph.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 16:42:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-22","authors_parsed":[["Lonc","Zbigniew",""],["Naroski","Pawe\\u0142",""],["Rz\\u0105\\u017cewski","Pawe\\u0142",""]]}\n"

The agreement test checks that the restrictions agree when\\nthey overlap, and the main question is whether average agreement of the local\\npieces implies that there exists a global function that agrees with most local\\nrestrictions.\\n  There are very few structures that support agreement tests, essentially\\neither coming from algebraic low degree tests or from direct product tests (and\\nrecently also from high-dimensional expanders). In this work, we prove a new\\nagreement theorem which extends direct product tests to higher dimensions,\\nanalogous to how low degree tests extend linearity testing. As a corollary of\\nour main theorem, it follows that an ensemble of small graphs on overlapping\\nsets of vertices can be glued together to one global graph assuming they agree\\nwith each other on average.\\n  We prove the agreement theorem by (re)proving the agreement theorem for\\ndimension 1, and then generalizing it to higher dimensions (with the dimension\\n1 case being the direct product test, and dimension 2 being the graph case). A\\nkey technical step in our proof is the reverse union bound, which allows us to\\ntreat dependent events as if they are disjoint, and may be of independent\\ninterest. An added benefit of the reverse union bound is that it can be used to\\nshow that the \\"majority decoded\\" function also serves as a global function that\\nexplains the local consistency of the agreement theorem, a fact that was not\\nknown even in the direct product setting (dimension 1) prior to our work.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 17:20:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 13:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14","authors_parsed":[["Dinur","Irit",""],["Filmus","Yuval",""],["Harsha","Prahladh",""]]}\n"

The resultant probabilistic\\nmodels assume that the underlying random variables, which define a measurable\\nset of outcomes, can be defined independent of the measurement context. The\\nphenomenon is deemed contextual when this assumption fails. Contextuality is an\\nimportant issue in quantum physics. However, there has been growing speculation\\nthat it manifests outside the quantum realm with human cognition being a\\nparticularly prominent area of investigation. This article contributes the\\nfoundations of a probabilistic programming language that allows convenient\\nexploration of contextuality in wide range of applications relevant to\\ncognitive science and artificial intelligence. Specific syntax is proposed to\\nallow the specification of \\"measurement contexts\\". Each such context delivers a\\npartial model of the phenomenon based on the associated experimental condition\\ndescribed by the measurement context.

The use of\\nhypergraphs opens the door for a theoretically succinct and efficient\\ncomputational semantics sensitive to modelling both contextual and\\nnon-contextual phenomena.

We\\nalso show that universal measurement-based quantum computing on our hypergraph\\nstate can be verified in polynomial time using only $X$ and $Z$-basis\\nmeasurements. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate an advantage of our\\nhypergraph state, we construct a verifiable blind quantum computing protocol\\nthat requires only $X$ and $Z$-basis measurements for the client.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 10:06:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 03:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24","authors_parsed":[["Takeuchi","Yuki",""],["Morimae","Tomoyuki",""],["Hayashi","Masahito",""]]}\n"

We asymptotically determine the Tur\\\\'an\\nnumber of $t$-heavy and $t$-wise Berge copies of long paths and cycles and\\nexactly determine the Tur\\\\'an number of $t$-heavy and $t$-wise Berge copies of\\ncliques.\\n  In the case of 3-uniform hypergraphs, we consider the problem in more details\\nand obtain additional results.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 18:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 12:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10","authors_parsed":[["Gerbner","D\\u00e1niel",""],["Nagy","D\\u00e1niel T.",""],["Patk\\u00f3s","Bal\\u00e1zs",""],["Vizer","M\\u00e1t\\u00e9",""]]}\n"

Yet, in many relevant cases, interactions are not pairwise but\\ninvolve larger sets of nodes, at a time. These systems are thus better\\ndescribed in the framework of hypergraphs, whose hyperedges effectively account\\nfor multi-body interactions. We hereby propose a new class of random walks\\ndefined on such higher-order structures, and grounded on a microscopic physical\\nmodel where multi-body proximity is associated to highly probable exchanges\\namong agents belonging to the same hyperedge. We provide an analytical\\ncharacterisation of the process, deriving a general solution for the stationary\\ndistribution of the walkers. The dynamics is ultimately driven by a generalised\\nrandom walk Laplace operator that reduces to the standard random walk Laplacian\\nwhen all the hyperedges have size 2 and are thus meant to describe pairwise\\ncouplings. We illustrate our results on synthetic models for which we have a\\nfull control of the high-order structures, and real-world networks where\\nhigher-order interactions are at play. As a first application of the method, we\\ncompare the behaviour of random walkers on hypergraphs to that of traditional\\nrandom walkers on the corresponding projected networks, drawing interesting\\nconclusions on node rankings in collaboration networks. As a second\\napplication, we show how information derived from the random walk on\\nhypergraphs can be successfully used for classification tasks involving objects\\nwith several features, each one represented by a hyperedge. Taken together, our\\nwork contributes to unveiling the effect of higher-order interactions on\\ndiffusive processes in higher-order networks, shading light on mechanisms at\\nthe hearth of biased information spreading in complex networked systems.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 08:59:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 19:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26","authors_parsed":[["Carletti","Timoteo",""],["Battiston","Federico",""],["Cencetti","Giulia",""],["Fanelli","Duccio",""]]}\n"

A standard analysis task is to identify clusters of closely\\nrelated or densely interconnected nodes. Many graph algorithms for this task\\nare based on variants of the stochastic blockmodel, a random graph with\\nflexible cluster structure. However, there are few models and algorithms for\\nhypergraph clustering. Here, we propose a Poisson degree-corrected hypergraph\\nstochastic blockmodel (DCHSBM), a generative model of clustered hypergraphs\\nwith heterogeneous node degrees and edge sizes. Approximate maximum-likelihood\\ninference in the DCHSBM naturally leads to a clustering objective that\\ngeneralizes the popular modularity objective for graphs. We derive a general\\nLouvain-type algorithm for this objective, as well as a a faster, specialized\\n\\"All-Or-Nothing\\" (AON) variant in which edges are expected to lie fully within\\nclusters. This special case encompasses a recent proposal for modularity in\\nhypergraphs, while also incorporating flexible resolution and edge-size\\nparameters. We show that AON hypergraph Louvain is highly scalable, including\\nas an example an experiment on a synthetic hypergraph of one million nodes. We\\nalso demonstrate through synthetic experiments that the detectability regimes\\nfor hypergraph community detection differ from methods based on dyadic graph\\nprojections.

By the\\ncelebrated result of Erd\\\\H{o}s from 1947, the random graph on $N$ vertices with\\nedge probability $1/2$, contains no clique or independent set larger than\\n$2\\\\log_2 N$, with high probability. Finding explicit constructions of graphs\\nwith similar Ramsey-type properties is a famous open problem. A natural\\napproach is to construct such graphs using algebraic tools. Say that an\\n$r$-uniform hypergraph $\\\\mathcal{H}$ is \\\\emph{algebraic of complexity\\n$(n,d,m)$} if the vertices of $\\\\mathcal{H}$ are elements of $\\\\mathbb{F}^{n}$\\nfor some field $\\\\mathbb{F}$, and there exist $m$ polynomials\\n$f_1,\\\\dots,f_m:(\\\\mathbb{F}^{n})^{r}\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{F}$ of degree at most\\n$d$ such that the edges of $\\\\mathcal{H}$ are determined by the zero-patterns of\\n$f_1,\\\\dots,f_m$. The aim of this paper is to show that if an algebraic graph\\n(or hypergraph) of complexity $(n,d,m)$ has good Ramsey properties, then at\\nleast one of the parameters $n,d,m$ must be large. In 2001, R\\\\'onyai, Babai and\\nGanapathy considered the bipartite variant of the Ramsey problem and proved\\nthat if $G$ is an algebraic graph of complexity $(n,d,m)$ on $N$ vertices, then\\neither $G$ or its complement contains a complete balanced bipartite graph of\\nsize $\\\\Omega_{n,d,m}(N^{1/(n+1)})$. We extend this result by showing that such\\n$G$ contains either a clique or an independent set of size $N^{\\\\Omega(1/ndm)}$\\nand prove similar results for algebraic hypergraphs of constant complexity.

A subset $F$ of\\nhyperedges is a $k$-cut-set if the number of connected components in $G - F$ is\\nat least $k$ and it is a minimum $k$-cut-set if it has the least cost among all\\n$k$-cut-sets. For fixed $k$, we call the problem of finding a minimum\\n$k$-cut-set as Hypergraph-$k$-Cut and the problem of enumerating all minimum\\n$k$-cut-sets as Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut. The special cases of\\nHypergraph-$k$-Cut and Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut restricted to graph inputs are\\nwell-known to be solvable in (randomized as well as deterministic) polynomial\\ntime. In contrast, it is only recently that polynomial-time algorithms for\\nHypergraph-$k$-Cut were developed. The randomized polynomial-time algorithm for\\nHypergraph-$k$-Cut that was designed in 2018 (Chandrasekaran, Xu, and Yu, SODA\\n2018) showed that the number of minimum $k$-cut-sets in a hypergraph is\\n$O(n^{2k-2})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input hypergraph, and\\nthat they can all be enumerated in randomized polynomial time, thus resolving\\nEnum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut in randomized polynomial time. A deterministic\\npolynomial-time algorithm for Hypergraph-$k$-Cut was subsequently designed in\\n2020 (Chandrasekaran and Chekuri, FOCS 2020), but it is not guaranteed to\\nenumerate all minimum $k$-cut-sets. In this work, we give the first\\ndeterministic polynomial-time algorithm to solve Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut (this\\nis non-trivial even for $k = 2$). Our algorithms are based on new structural\\nresults that allow for efficient recovery of all minimum $k$-cut-sets by\\nsolving minimum $(S,T)$-terminal cuts. Our techniques give new structural\\ninsights even for enumerating all minimum cut-sets (i.e., minimum 2-cut-sets)\\nin a given hypergraph.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 23:49:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 15:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01","authors_parsed":[["Beideman","Calvin",""],["Chandrasekaran","Karthekeyan",""],["Wang","Weihang",""]]}\n"

Also, a recent study by Broido and Clauset\\nsuggests that a power-law degree distribution is not as ubiquitous in the\\nnatural systems as it was thought so far. They experimentally confirm that a\\nmajority of networks (56% of around 1000 networks that undergone the test)\\nfavor a power-law with an exponential cutoff over other distributions. We\\naddress the two above observations by introducing a preferential attachment\\nhypergraph model which allows for vertex deactivations. The phenomenon of\\nvertex deactivations is rare in existing theoretical models and omnipresent in\\nreal-life scenarios (social network accounts which are not maintained forever,\\ncollaboration networks in which people retire, technological networks in which\\ndevices break down). We prove that the degree distribution of the proposed\\nmodel follows a power-law with an exponential cutoff.

This framework also allows us to introduce different ingredients such as\\nthe preferential attachment for hypergraphs, or spatial random hypergraphs. In\\nparticular, we show that for the Erdos-Renyi case there is a transition\\nthreshold scaling as $1/\\\\sqrt{EN}$ where $N$ is the number of nodes and $E$ the\\nnumber of hyperedges. We also discuss a random geometric hypergraph which\\ndisplays a percolation transition for a threshold distance scaling as\\n$r_c^*\\\\sim 1/\\\\sqrt{E}$. For these various models, we provide results for the\\nmost interesting measures, and also introduce new ones in the spatial case for\\ncharacterizing the geometrical properties of hyperedges. These different models\\nmight serve as benchmarks useful for analyzing empirical data.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 11:02:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 15:07:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2022 10:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28","authors_parsed":[["Barthelemy","Marc",""]]}\n"

A hypergraph is a network in which group interactions occur among more\\nthan two elements. In this study, first, we propose a method to identify\\ninfluential subgroups in hypergraphs, named $(k,q)$-core decomposition. The\\n$(k,q)$-core is defined as the maximal subgraph in which each vertex has at\\nleast $k$ hypergraph degrees \\\\textit{and} each hyperedge contains at least $q$\\nvertices. The method contains a repeated pruning process until reaching the\\n$(k,q)$-core, which shares similarities with a widely used $k$-core\\ndecomposition technique in a graph. Second, we analyze the pruning dynamics and\\nthe percolation transition with theoretical and numerical methods in random\\nhypergraphs. We set up evolution equations for the pruning process, and\\nself-consistency equations for the percolation properties. Based on our theory,\\nwe find that the pruning process generates a hybrid percolation transition for\\neither $k\\\\ge 3$ \\\\textit{or} $q\\\\ge 3$.

Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory\\ninteraction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two\\nother nodes.

However, the regulatory interactions may\\nnot only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also\\nbetween regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to\\nhigher-order triadic interactions.

As empirical hypergraphs grow in size, characterizing their structural properties becomes increasingly challenging due to computational complexity and, in some cases, restricted access to complete data, requiring efficient sampling methods. Random walks offer a practical approach to hypergraph sampling, as they rely solely on local neighborhood information from nodes and hyperedges. In this study, we investigate methods for simultaneously sampling nodes and hyperedges via random walks on large hypergraphs. First, we compare three existing random walks in the context of hypergraph sampling and identify an advantage of the so-called higher-order random walk. Second, by extending an established technique for graphs to the case of hypergraphs, we present a non-backtracking variant of the higher-order random walk. We derive theoretical results on estimators based on the non-backtracking higher-order random walk and validate them through numerical simulations on large empirical hypergraphs. Third, we apply the non-backtracking higher-order random walk to a large hypergraph of co-authorships indexed in the OpenAlex database, where full access to the data is not readily available. Despite the relatively small sample size, our estimates largely align with previous findings on author productivity, team size, and the prevalence of open-access publications. Our findings contribute to the development of analysis methods for large hypergraphs, offering insights into sampling strategies and estimation techniques applicable to real-world complex systems.","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2025 10:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 03 Jun 2025 15:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2025-06-04","authors_parsed":[["Nakajima","Kazuki",""],["Kodakari","Masanao",""],["Aida","Masaki",""]]}\n"

When modelling systems where interactions extend beyond node pairs to arbitrary numbers of nodes, hypergraphs become necessary, creating a need for specialised community detection methods. Here, we adapt the classical $k$-clique percolation method to hypergraphs, constructing communities from hyperedges containing at least $k$ nodes, defining hyperedge adjacency similarly to clique adjacency. Although the analogy between the proposed hyperedge percolation method and the classical clique percolation algorithm is evident, we show that communities obtained directly from the hyperedges can differ from those identified via clique percolation on the pairwise projection of the hypergraph. We also propose an alternative way for merging hyperedges into communities, where instead of imposing a lower bound on hyperedge cardinality, we restrict the maximum size of the considered hyperedges. This alternative algorithm better suits hypergraphs where larger hyperedges realise weaker linkages between the nodes. After comparing the suggested two approaches on simple synthetic hypergraphs designed to highlight their distinctions, we test them on hypergraphs generated by a newly proposed geometric process on the hyperbolic plane, as well as on some real-world examples.","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:35:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2025 13:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2025-06-18","authors_parsed":[["Kov\\u00e1cs","Bianka",""],["Benedek","Barnab\\u00e1s",""],["Palla","Gergely",""]]}\n"

First, we propose an algorithm to generate the maximal cliques of multi-hypergraphs associated with completely positive tensors. This also leads to a necessary condition for tensors to be completely positive. Then, the completely positive tensor decomposition problem is reformulated into an ideal-sparse generalized moment problem. It optimizes over several lower dimensional measure variables supported on the maximal cliques of a multi-hypergraph. The moment-based relaxations are applied to solve the reformulation. The convergence of this ideal-sparse moment hierarchies is studied. Numerical results show that the ideal-sparse problem is faster to compute than the original dense formulation of completely positive tensor decomposition problems. It also illustrates that the new reformulation utilizes sparsity structures that differs from the correlative and term sparsity for completely positive tensor decomposition problems.","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2025 03:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2025-05-22","authors_parsed":[["Huang","Pengfei",""],["Bai","Minru",""]]}\n"

In line clustering, points in a Euclidean space must be grouped so that each cluster is well approximated by a line segment. Since any two points define a line, pairwise similarities fail to capture the structure of the problem, necessitating the use of higher-order interactions modeled by geometric hypergraphs. We encode geometry into a 3-uniform hypergraph by treating sets of three points as hyperedges whenever they are approximately collinear. The resulting hypergraph contains information about the underlying line segments, which can then be extracted using community recovery algorithms. In contrast to classical hypergraph block models, latent geometric constraints in this construction introduce significant dependencies between hyperedges, which restricts the applicability of many standard theoretical tools. We aim to determine the fundamental limits of line clustering and evaluate hypergraph-based line clustering methods. To this end, we derive information-theoretic thresholds for exact and almost exact recovery for data generated from intersecting lines on a plane with additive Gaussian noise. We develop a polynomial-time spectral algorithm and show that it succeeds under noise conditions that match the information-theoretic bounds up to a polylogarithmic factor.","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2025 17:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2025-06-02","authors_parsed":[["Alaluusua","Kalle",""],["Avrachenkov","Konstantin",""],["Kumar","B.

Temporal hypergraphs are given by ordered sequences of hyperedges representing sets of nodes interacting at given points in time. In this paper we discuss how a recently proposed model family for time-stamped hyperedges - relational hyperevent models (RHEM) - can be employed to define tailored null distributions for temporal hypergraphs. RHEM can be specified with a given vector of temporal hyperedge statistics - functions that quantify the structural position of hyperedges in the history of previous hyperedges - and equate expected values of these statistics with their empirically observed values. This allows, for instance, to analyze the overrepresentation or underrepresentation of temporal hyperedge configurations in a model that reproduces the observed distributions of possibly complex sub-configurations, including but going beyond node degrees. Concrete examples include, but are not limited to, preferential attachment, repetition of subsets of any given size, triadic closure, homophily, and degree assortativity for subsets of any order.","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 02 Jun 2025 08:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2025-06-03","authors_parsed":[["Lerner","J\\u00fcrgen",""],["H\\u00e2ncean","Marian-Gabriel",""],["Perc","Matjaz",""]]}\n"

Standard partitioning heuristics often neglect gate-specific error impacts, leading to suboptimal divisions with significant communication overhead and reduced fidelity. This paper introduces Fidelipart, a novel framework that transforms quantum circuits into a fidelity-aware hypergraph. In this model, gate error rates and structural dependencies inform the weights of nodes (gates) and hyperedges (representing multi-qubit interactions and qubit timelines), guiding an Mt-KaHyPar partitioner to minimize cuts through error-prone operations.\\n  We evaluated Fidelipart against BQSKit's QuickPartitioner on 6-qubit/22-gate, 10-qubit/55-gate, and 24-qubit/88-gate benchmarks under a linear topology with a consistent local contiguous re-mapping strategy. Results demonstrate Fidelipart's superior performance. It achieved SWAP gate reductions ranging from 77.3% to 100% and up to a 52.2% decrease in cut qubits. These physical improvements directly translated to estimated fidelity gains ranging from 27.3% to over 250%. While Fidelipart showed a modest runtime increase of 8-13% and variable effects on maximum partition depth, its substantial enhancement of circuit fidelity highlights the significant benefits of integrating detailed error-awareness into the partitioning process for more reliable NISQ computations.","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 07 Jun 2025 17:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 16:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2025-06-11","authors_parsed":[["Wehbe","Awad",""],["Khatib","Safiya Al",""],["Ahmad","AbdelMehsen",""]]}\n"

This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely studied, revealing several types of chimeras. Most cases involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction, modeled via networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the non-reciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the one resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2025 13:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2025-06-17","authors_parsed":[["Djeudjo","Rommel Tchinda",""],["Carletti","Timoteo",""],["Nakao","Hiroya",""],["Muolo","Riccardo",""]]}\n"

In particular, if $\\\\rho$ is inside the\\nscaling window (more precisely, $\\\\rho=\\\\rho_{\\\\mathrm{c}}+rn^{-1/2}$), the\\nprobability of having a core of size $\\\\Theta(n)$ has a limit strictly between 0\\nand 1, and a leading correction of order $\\\\Theta(n^{-1/6})$. The correction\\nadmits a sharp characterization in terms of the distribution of a Brownian\\nmotion with quadratic shift, from which it inherits the scaling with $n$. This\\nbehavior is expected to be universal for a wide collection of combinatorial\\nproblems.\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2007 01:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2008 07:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-18","authors_parsed":[["Dembo","Amir",""],["Montanari","Andrea",""]]}\n"
